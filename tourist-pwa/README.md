## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- Backend API running at `http://localhost:3001`

### Installation

```powershell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

App opens at `http://localhost:3000`

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

## Configuration

### Backend URL

The PWA auto-detects the backend URL based on hostname. To manually configure:

```javascript
// In browser console or app code
localStorage.setItem('BACKEND_URL', 'http://your-backend:3001');
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` file (optional):

```env
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
REACT_APP_API_TIMEOUT=10000

- `POST /api/v1/panic` - Trigger panic alert

### WebSocket
- `locationUpdate` - Real-time location updates
- `panicAlert` - Emergency notifications
- `anomalyAlert` - Anomaly detection alerts

## Features Detail

### Incident Reporting Flow

1. User clicks category (e.g., "Women Safety")
2. PWA navigates to `#/report-incident?cat=women_safety`
3. Form pre-selects category
4. User fills description and location (or auto-detects)
5. Optional: Add reporter name/contact
6. Submit ‚Üí Backend creates incident
7. Backend auto-forwards to relevant services (police, hospital, etc.)
8. User sees confirmation with incident ID and status

### Location Tracking

The PWA implements intelligent GPS filtering:
- Accuracy thresholds (rejects > 5km uncertainty)
- Speed validation (rejects physically impossible jumps)
- Moving average smoothing (5-point buffer)
- Minimal bandwidth usage (only sends significant changes)

### Family Dashboard

- Real-time map with all family members
- Color-coded status indicators:
  - Green: Active
  - Red: Distress
  - Yellow: Anomaly detected
  - Gray: Offline
- Group dislocation alerts when members separate > threshold

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Connecting

Check browser console for errors. Common issues:
- Backend not running (start with `npm start` in `backend-api/`)
- Wrong URL in localStorage
- CORS issues (backend should allow localhost)

### Location Not Updating

- Check browser location permissions
- Ensure HTTPS (or localhost) for geolocation API
- Verify WebSocket connection in Network tab

### Map Not Loading

- Check internet connection for tile downloads
- Verify Leaflet CSS is imported
- Clear browser cache

## Production Build

```powershell
# Create optimized build
npm run build

# Serve with a static server
npx serve -s build -p 3000
```

Or deploy to:
- **Netlify**: Drag `build/` folder to Netlify
- **Vercel**: Connect GitHub repo
- **Azure Static Web Apps**: Use GitHub Actions
